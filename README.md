## ⚙️ Architecture

This project is built as a **three-tier application**:

- 🖥️ **User Interface** (desktop GUI)

- 🧠 **Application Logic** (C#/.NET)

- 🗄️ **Database Layer** (relational model)

## 🔄 Development Methodology

The system follows a simplified **Larman method**, with the following phases:

1. 📋 **Requirements Gathering** – Functional and non-functional requirements specification

2. 🧩 **Analysis** – Domain modeling, system operations, sequence diagrams

3. 🏗️ **Design** – Layered architecture definition using modern design principles

4. 💻 **Implementation** – Development using C# and .NET with clean code practices

5. 🧪 **Testing** – Verifying functionality, performance, and reliability

## ✅ Key Features

- 👨‍⚕️ Patient & doctor management

- 📁 Health record tracking

- 📜 Certificate and diagnosis generation

- 🔐 Data consistency & secure communication

- 🛠️ Maintainable, extensible architecture

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates a robust and scalable software solution for healthcare institutions. Designed with clear separation of concerns and proven design patterns, it provides a reliable and usable platform for real-world scenarios.
